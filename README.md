## EZO_I2C_Lib_Linux
API to interface with Atlas Scientific EZO devices on Linux. So we can use them with boards that run Linux.

### Why?
Because Atlas Scientific only provides libraries for Arduino (https://github.com/Atlas-Scientific/Ezo_I2c_lib).

### Prerequisites
Linux image with working /dev/i2c drivers.

### Build
```
make
```

### Linking

See Makefile for example.
